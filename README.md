#GREATER THAN MATH TRAINER

## This is a simple Math Trainer Game.


Program shows 2 random equations; possible formats are as follows:

- (x + y)
- (x - y)
- (x + y) - z
- (x - y) + z

User may set maximum number possible per variable by editing MAX_VALUE in program

Statistics of the user is shown; format is as follows:

**[T] [ P :: M :: C ] [%] [S]**

Where:

*T = Trials
P = Points / Score
M = Mistakes
C = Corrects
% = Percantage of correct answers
S = Average time taken to answer a question in seconds*
